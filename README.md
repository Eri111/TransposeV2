# TransposeV2

This Project contains a parallel matrix transposition with
multiple parallelization frameworks (OpenMP, TBB and stl parallel execution policies)

This project was part of the Parallel Algorithm Design Course at Heidelberg University.

The results documentation can be found in `./PAD_Transpose_Presentation.pdf`

The project depends on [googlebenchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark)
